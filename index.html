                    <h1>LAB ASSISTANT</h1>
                    <p>During my 3-month tenure as a lab assistant at ARR Towers in Karur, Tamil Nadu, 
                        I played a vital role in dental CT scans. Operating equipment, ensuring patient safety, 
                        and assisting with data collection were among my responsibilities.
                         This experience honed my attention to detail, communication skills, and technical proficiency in medical imaging, 
                         contributing to the broader healthcare process.</p>

                        I trained staff on various medical devices, focusing on operation, maintenance, and safety. 
                        This enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical information clearly,
                         improving my overall communication skills and expertise in medical equipment training.</p>
